# FlightCheck

FlightCheck is a simple post flight tool to check if the mission was complete, i.e., pictures for all field were saved. It is useful for cases when the sensor capturing images is not directly connected to the flight mission software and there is no guarantee all the images were saved. Our motivation was because some the Micasense RedEdge-3 attached to our DJI Matrice 100 was not saving data - which means no guarantee that after taking off we would have any picture in the end. We usually check our folders after flight, having one idea of how many folders with pictures would be expected. However, we wanted to simplify this task, where we could select the storage device (SD card or pendrive) and look at the GPS position of the pictures.


## Example

Here are some examples of flights on winter and spring wheat conducted by the PhD candidate Mei Ling Wong. In the first case, we missed the final part of the flight - after stopping the drone for changing its battery for the second time.
