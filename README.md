# FlightCheck

FlightCheck is a simple post flight tool to check if the mission was complete, i.e., pictures for all field were saved. It is useful for cases when the sensor capturing images is not directly connected to the flight mission software and there is no guarantee all the images were saved. Our motivation was because some the Micasense RedEdge-3 attached to our Matrice 100 would not save data - having no guarantee that after taking off we would have any picture in the end. We usually check our folders after flight, having one idea of how many folders with pictures would be expected. However, we wanted to simplify this task, where we could select the storage device (SD card or pendrive) and look at the GPS position of the pictures.
